  This project was designed to display some basic instructions when you create
  a new game.  Simply delete the following code and implement your own Init(),
  Update() and Draw() logic.

function Init()

  -- Display the instructions
  DrawText("Press the 1 or 2 key", 1, 1, DrawMode.Tile, "large", 15)
  DrawText("Channel 0 is playing ", 1, 2, DrawMode.Tile, "large", 15)
  DrawText("Channel 1 is playing ", 1, 3, DrawMode.Tile, "large", 15)

end

function Update(timeDelta)

  -- Check for the 1 key to be pressed and play sound ID 0 on channel 0
  if(Key(Keys.Alpha1, InputState.Released)) then
    PlaySound(0, 0)
  end

  -- Only play sound 1 if the channel is not currently playing a sound
  if(Key(Keys.Alpha2, InputState.Released) and IsChannelPlaying(1) == false) then
    PlaySound(1, 1)
  end

end

-- The Draw() method is part of the game's life cycle. It is called after Update() and is where
-- all of our draw calls should go. We'll be using this to render sprites to the display.
function Draw()

  -- Redraw the display
  RedrawDisplay()

  -- Draw channel 0 and 1's current playing state to the display
  DrawText(tostring(IsChannelPlaying(0)), 176, 16, DrawMode.Sprite, "large", 14)
  DrawText(tostring(IsChannelPlaying(1)), 176, 24, DrawMode.Sprite, "large", 14)

end
